# Hospital Management App Roadmap

## Overview
This project is a Hospital Management App built using Python Flask for the backend, MySQL as the database, and Bootstrap HTML for the user interface. The app will include features for user authentication, a dashboard, and management systems for users, doctors, appointments, and patients.

## Milestones

### 1. Authentication System
- **Login Page**:
  - Create a form with fields for username and password.
  - Implement backend authentication logic using Flask and MySQL connector.
  - Display error messages for invalid credentials.
- **User Roles**:
  - Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Doctor, Receptionist).
  - Set up role-based access controls.
- **Session Management**:
  - Use Flask sessions to maintain login state.

### 2. Dashboard
- **Dashboard Overview**:
  - Display upcoming scheduled appointments in a table.
  - Include a summary section (e.g., total patients, total appointments).
  - Show role-specific information (e.g., a doctor's schedule).

### 3. Navigation Bar
- **Navbar Links**:
  - Add links for:
    - User Management
    - Doctor Management
    - Appointment Scheduling
    - Patient Management
  - Highlight the active page in the navbar.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Use Bootstrap for a responsive and accessible navigation bar.

### 4. User Management
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete user profiles.
  - Assign roles to users.
- **User List Page**:
  - Display all users in a table with options to edit or delete.

### 5. Doctor Management
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Manage doctor profiles (e.g., name, specialization, availability).
- **Doctor List Page**:
  - Display all doctors in a table with options to edit or delete.

### 6. Appointment Scheduling
- **Book Appointments**:
  - Create a form to schedule appointments.
- **Manage Appointments**:
  - Allow rescheduling and cancellation of appointments.
- **Appointment List Page**:
  - Show all appointments in a sortable table.

## Development Steps
1. Set up Flask project structure.
2. Configure MySQL database and create tables for users, doctors, appointments, and patients.
3. Implement the authentication system.
4. Build the dashboard and integrate it with the database.
5. Develop individual management modules (User, Doctor, Appointment, Patient).
6. Test the application for security, performance, and usability.

## Next Steps
- Define database schema for all modules.
- Begin with the authentication system and login page.
- Expand the app iteratively, starting with the dashboard and navigation bar.

---

## Notes
- Focus on modular development for easier scalability.
- Ensure compliance with data security standards (e.g., password hashing, session expiration).
